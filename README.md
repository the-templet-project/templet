##  **TEMPLET** -- a framework for actor-task computing 
*******************************************************

[The Templet project](http://templet.ssau.ru) exists to take full advantage of computing resources in scientific, educational and industrial applications through the implementation of *actor-task computing*, a generic approach that adapts [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for [many-task computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-task_computing) across multiple cores, clusters, and the Internet.

The current implementation supports the [Everest platform](http://everest.distcomp.org) for managing the execution of parallel tasks on distributed computing resources over the Internet. It can also model logic and measure the performance of a complex many-task workflow on a single computer.

You can try Templet
* interactively with Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/the-templet-project/templet.git/master?urlpath=lab), 
* or use the provided [MS Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) project files,
* or compile the source files in any C ++ programming environment.

### Repository structure
************************
The software package consists of three components.
1. Code generator driven by lightweight actor specification language.
2. The C ++ library that implements the actor engine and several task engines for integration with [Everest](http://everest.distcomp.org), behavior and performance modeling, etc.
3. Gallery of small examples of many-task applications.

The components are arranged as described below.
