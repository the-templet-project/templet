##  **TEMPLET** -- a framework for actor-task computing 
*******************************************************

[The Templet project](http://templet.ssau.ru) exists to take full advantage of computing resources in scientific, educational and industrial applications through the implementation of *actor-task computing*, a generic approach that adapts [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for [many-task computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-task_computing) across multiple cores, clusters, and the Internet.

The current implementation supports the [Everest platform](http://everest.distcomp.org) for managing the execution of parallel tasks on distributed computing resources over the Internet. It can also model logic and measure the performance of a complex many-task workflow on a single computer.

You can try Templet
* interactively with Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/the-templet-project/templet.git/master?urlpath=lab), 
* or use the provided [MS Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) project files,
* or compile the source files in any C ++ programming environment.

### Repository structure
************************
The software package consists of three components.
1. Code generator driven by lightweight actor specification language.
2. The C ++ library that implements the actor engine and several task engines for integration with [Everest](http://everest.distcomp.org), behavior and performance modeling, etc.
3. Gallery of small examples of many-task applications.

The components are arranged as described below.
* **~/bin/** – code generator executables, curl binaries for Windows, quick info on MS VC++ redistributable packages
* **~/binder/** – Binder configuration files
* **~/lib/** – Templet C++ library source files
* **~/lib/opt/** – external packages including libcurl and JSON for Modern C++
* **~/lib/speclang.txt** – technical overview of the lightweight actor specification language
* **~/lib/templet.hpp** – core actor engine and base task engine
* **~/lib/everest.hpp** – Everest task engine
* **~/lib/basesim.hpp** – task engine for the paracomputer simulation;
* **~/cgen/** – code generator sources
* **~/cgen/acta** - integrated actor-task model processor
* **~/cgen/cgen** - code generator for actor-task model
* **~/cgen/skel** - skeleton processor
* **~/samples/** – gallery of small examples
* **~/samples/brickmov/** – model of transferring bricks from the original heap to the new one along the chain of workers
* **~/samples/diamond/** – demonstration of the paracomputer simulation engine
* **~/samples/evrstagnt/** - installing and verifying the Everest agent on the Binder virtual machine
* **~/samples/heatomp/** - solving the heat equation using multicore systems with OpenMP 2.0 or higher
* **~/samples/parsweep/** - parameter sweep application (calculation of the Lyapunov spectrum for the Lorentz equation with different values of rho, sigma, beta)
* **~/samples/pingpong/** – demonstration of the Everest task engine
* **~/samples/primempi/** - distributed prime search algorithm
* **~/samples/pythagor/** – demonstration of the lightweight actor specification language, core actor engine and base task engine APIs

* I also added a Dockerfile so that based on the image sehrig / cling: 0.7-dev
You can then run the docker compose file and run locally the jupiter lab environment with all the C++ libraries and it will work, if you need to specify different paths in the docker compose file, you are free to do this.

In order to build your own docker image with the necessary binary files, you must perform the following steps:

docker build -t jupyter-notebook1 .

after that, the download of the image and the addition and compilation of the necessary binaries will begin

these actions are made so that laptops with c ++ syntax can be executed

then feel free to run the command:
docker-compose-up
in turn, in the terminal you will see that the environment will unfold
